<p>As title says - My Proudest Creation. Creating my first personal webpage made me look into aspects that I was not very conserned about before. I managed to push myself to learn new things, technologies and shape my current working environment that I will proudly use for my future projects. Using Jade(HTML) and SASS(CSS) preprocessors showed me how important structure is and how clean code can be written. Managing responsivness all by your self-showed me how carefully work has to be overlooked before releasing it to the daylight.</p>

<p>Making simple and not over complicated design tells that I prefer perfection and minimalistic approach with a pinch of interactives to give my webpage liveliness. I can clearly say that the final product made me smarter person than I was in the beginning of this project.</p>
