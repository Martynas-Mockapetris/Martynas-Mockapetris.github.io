<p>Project that was fully based on learning parallax effects on the webpage. Reading a lot of text or scrolling through page can be boring, using parallax effects helps to make your monotonic webpage to be more lively. In the picture below I used 3 type of parallax effects:
• Scroll effect in header to have a 3D look with the birds flying away
• Gallery slide-in that is triggered by reaching specified breaking point
• Post scroll effect triggered by the breaking point

<p>Many other parallax effects can made and I don't mind to explain them during our interview.</p>
