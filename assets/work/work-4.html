<p>I know what you say now, "Look another unfinished work...", but take a look on the elements I use here. Repeating myself, webpages can be monotonic and in order  
to solve that, people use interactive design and these are some of the examples how this can be done.</p>

<p>• Menu that is hidden on its primary and displayed by person clicking on it pushing all content to the side.</p>

<p>• Gallery that fades-in with thumbnails and begins to display a slideshow.</p>
