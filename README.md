Project: Personal Webpage/Portfolio<br>
Title: Martynas Mockapetris Personal Portfolio

Webpage that was built using Jade and Sass preprocessors.<br>
Working environmnet was set using jekyll and gulp.

Jekyll was used as a CMS to control the entire workflow of the project.<br>
Gulp was used to run a local server with a live reload.

Additional information that has to be mentioned is:<br>
Skeleton was used as a workframe for the webpage main layout.<br>
Bourbon was used to even more lighten work with SASS.<br>
Inspiration and Motivation was taken from Travis Devtips.<br>

Entire responsiveness was built from scratch so minor errors accross<br>
devices might occur. Over time I believe I will manage to fix all of them<br>
if not already did that.

Thank you all who have helped me and participated in this project,<br>
without them this would not be in the daylight.
